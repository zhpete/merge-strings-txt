# Merge strings.txt

Merge strings.txt files for Frosty

## Usage

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to be installed.

I was lazy with coding it so the input and output dirs are hardcoded.

1. Open a terminal in the project root and run the following:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
2. Copy your strings files in to the `src` directory. (must be `.txt` files with newline separated strings)
3. Open a terminal in `src` and run the following:
    ```sh
    node .
    ```
4. Retrieve the generated merged and sorted string file from `src/output`
